# AsyncQueue

A header-only C++ library implementing a thread-safe asynchronous queue with timeout support.

## Features
- Thread-safe operations
- Configurable capacity
- Timeout support for push/pop operations
- Move semantics support
- Extension support through virtual hooks
- Header-only implementation

## Integration

### Method 1: CMake FetchContent
```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    async_queue
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/HarryPehkonen/AsyncQueue.git
    GIT_TAG v0.1.2
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(async_queue)

# Link against the library
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE async_queue::async_queue)
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarryPehkonen/AsyncQueue.git
cd async_queue
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```

Then in your project's CMakeLists.txt:
```cmake
find_package(async_queue REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE async_queue::async_queue)
```

## Usage Example
```cpp
#include <async_queue/async_queue.hpp>

async_queue::AsyncQueue<int> queue(100);  // Queue with capacity 100

// Producer
queue.push(42);
queue.try_push(43, std::chrono::milliseconds(100));

// Consumer
auto value = queue.pop();
if (value) {
    std::cout << "Received: " << *value << std::endl;
}
```

### `push` vs `try_push`:

1. `push` is a blocking call - it will wait indefinitely until:
   - There is space in the queue (if at capacity)
   - OR the queue is closed
2. `try_push` has a timeout parameter and will only wait up to that duration before:
   - Successfully adding the item if space becomes available
   - OR returning false if the timeout expires
   - OR returning false if the queue is closed

### `pop` vs `try_pop`:

1. `pop` is a blocking call - it will wait indefinitely until:
   - There is an item to retrieve
   - OR the queue is closed
2. `try_pop` has a timeout parameter and will only wait up to that duration before:
   - Successfully retrieving an item if one becomes available
   - OR returning nullopt if the timeout expires
   - OR returning nullopt if the queue is closed and empty


### The following tests demonstrate the key differences

PushBlocking, TryPushNonBlocking, PopBlocking, TryPopNonBlocking, TryPushSuccessful, and TryPopSuccessful

1. `push`/`pop` will wait indefinitely:
   - Good when you know the operation must eventually succeed
   - Useful for producer-consumer scenarios where blocking is acceptable

2. `try_push`/`try_pop` provide timeout control:
   - Good for handling timeouts gracefully
   - Useful when you need to avoid deadlocks
   - Better for scenarios where waiting indefinitely is not acceptable

3. The try_* versions are particularly useful when:
   - You need to implement timeouts for reliability
   - You want to avoid potential deadlocks
   - You need to handle failure cases explicitly
   - You're implementing cancelable operations

## Building Tests
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DASYNC_QUEUE_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```
